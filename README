We (Mozilla Security Assurance) have been thinking for some time about making a whitelist filter (such as Michael Eddington's reform library) easily accessible to web devs. As we use Django with Jinja2 at Mozilla, this seemed like an ideal target for a first kick.

This is a rough and ready early release. To use, include the filter methods in filters.py as jinja2 filters. A (lightly) modified version of reform is included.

The Rules:
==========
These filters can only help you if you follow some basic rules:
* Always be explicit about document type and encoding
* Never put untrusted data directly in a script
* Never put untrusted data directly inside an HTML comment
* Never put untrusted data in an attribute name
* Never put untrusted data in a tag name
* Never put untrusted data directly in CSS

These rules are from OWASPs XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, I recommend you read this document: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet

Examples:
=========
This shows use of url attribute and 'plain' html attribute filters:
<img src='{{ imgurl|urlattribute }}' alt="{{ alttext|htmlattribute }}">

This shows use of URL parameter filter:
<a href="/some/base/url?param1={{ param | urlparam }}&param2=foo">other</a>

And here's some use of the CSS URL filter and the standard CSS value filter:
<div style="background-image: url({{ cssstuff|cssurl }}); color:{{ csscol|cssvalue }}">...</div>
