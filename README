Some colleagues and I have been thinking for some time about making a whitelist filter (such as Michael Eddington's reform library) easily accessible to web devs. As we use Django with Jinja2 at Mozilla, this seemed like an ideal target for a first kick.

This is a rough and ready early release. To use, include the filter methods in filters.py as jinja2 filters. A (lightly) modified version of reform is included.

Examples:
=========
This shows use of url attribute and 'plain' html attribute filters:
<img src='{{ imgurl|urlattributefilter }}' alt="{{ alttext|htmlattributefilter }}">

This shows use of URL parameter filter:
<a href="http://example.com/thing?param1={{ param | urlparamfilter }}&param2=foo">other</a>

And here's some use of the CSS URL filter and the standard CSS value filter:
<div style="background-image: url({{ cssstuff|cssurlfilter }}); color:{{ csscol|cssfilter }}">...</div>
